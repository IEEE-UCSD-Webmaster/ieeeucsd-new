### Introduction

#### **Welcome to the CLI**
If you have never used the command line interface (CLI) before, then now is the time to embark on a journey to a new realm where simplicity meets power. It’s the key to making computers do exactly what you want, how you want it, when you want it. It is a direct line of communication to your OS. As you learn each new command, you’ll find yourself with the ability to conjure tasks and vanquish errors.

Do not be daunted by the stark text and blinking cursor. They are your allies on this journey. This is the beginning of a journey to technological enlightenment!

#### **Terminal Access Across Different Operating Systems**

Accessing the Terminal can vary depending on the operating system in use. Here’s how to access it on the most commonly used systems

**macOS**
 
- Navigate to `/Applications/Utilities/` and double-click on Terminal.
- Alternatively, use Spotlight by pressing `Command + Space`, typing `Terminal` and pressing Enter.
